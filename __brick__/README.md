# Turnkey Flutter Demo App

This demo app leverages Turnkey's Dart/Flutter packages to demonstrate how they can be used to create a fully functional application. It includes a simple Node.js backend API server to facilitate server-side operations.

## Prerequisites

_Note: version numbers are approximated. Older or newer versions may or may not work correctly._

| Requirement    | Version  |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Flutter        | >= 3.0.0 |
| Dart           | >= 3.0.0 |
| Xcode          | >= 12.0  |
| Android Studio | >= 4.0   |
| Node.js        | >= 14.0  |

## Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a template:

```python
TURNKEY_API_URL="https://api.turnkey.com"
BACKEND_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
ORGANIZATION_ID="<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>"

# PASSKEY ENV VARIABLES
RP_ID="<YOUR_RP_ID>"                    # This is the relying party ID that hosts your .well-known file

# GOOGLE AUTH ENV VARIABLES
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>"
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_SCHEME="<YOUR_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_SCHEME>"

#NODE SERVER ENV VARIABLES (Only used for the Node server in /api-server)
TURNKEY_API_PUBLIC_KEY="<YOUR_TURNKEY_API_PUBLIC_KEY>"
TURNKEY_API_PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_TURNKEY_API_PRIVATE_KEY>"
BACKEND_API_PORT="3000"

```

## Backend API Server

This app must be connected to a backend server. You can use the included Node.js backend API server or set up your own.

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the api-server directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd api-server
npm install
```

Build and Run the Backend Server

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Running the Flutter App

### Install Dependancies

Navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project and install the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Run the Flutter App

You can run the app on a connected device or emulator using the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

You will be prompted to select a device to run the app on. You can also use the Flutter VSCode extension to run the app and select the device.

## OAuth Configuration (optional)

This app includes an example for authenticating with Turnkey using a Google or Apple account.

### Sign in with Google

Signing in with Google uses the [openid_client](https://pub.dev/packages/openid_client) package which can be configured to authenticate using most OIDC providers.

Add your Google client id and redirect scheme to your .env file. These can be retrieved from your [Google Devloper Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

```python
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>"
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_SCHEME="<YOUR_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_SCHEME>"
```

Update your [info.plist](ios/Runner/Info.plist) file to add your redirect scheme on iOS:

_Replace com.googleusercontent.apps.1234567890-abcdef with your actual redirect scheme_

```html
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.1234567890-abcdef</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.1234567890-abcdef</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

Update your main [AndroidManifest.xml](android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) to include this scheme as well:

```html
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  <data
    android:scheme="com.googleusercontent.apps.1234567890-abcdef"
    android:host=""
  />
</intent-filter>
```

### Sign in with Apple

Signing in with Apple leverages the [sign_in_with_apple](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple) packages. This allows Apple's native [Sign in With Apple SDK](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapple) to be used in Flutter.

To enable this feature, simply [add the **Sign in with Apple** capability to your app in Xcode.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app)

## Passkey Configuration (optional)

To allow passkeys to be registered on iOS and Android, you must set up an associated domain. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Turnkey Flutter Passkey Stamper README](/packages/passkey-stamper) or [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains) and [Google's](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager#add-support-dal) respective instruction pages.

Once you have this setup, add your relying party server's domain to your .env file

```python
RP_ID="example.example.com"
```
